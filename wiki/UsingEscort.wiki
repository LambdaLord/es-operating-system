#summary Using Escort

= Using Escort Web Browser =

*Note*: Escort is still at an early phase of the development.
The current alpha (unstable) version is still evolving and some parts are not implemented yet.

== Setup ==

=== Fedora 17, 18 / Ubuntu 12.10 ===

We provide a yum-style repository for Fedora and
a deb-style repository for Ubuntu 
at [http://download.esrille.org/ download.esrille.org].
Please follow the instructions there.

=== Other Linux distributions ===

Escort needs to be built and installed from the source files at this point.
Please refer to the 
[http://es-operating-system.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/setup.escort setup script]
for Fedora and Ubuntu to see how to configure the Makefile.

=== Mac OS X (Lion/Mountain Lion) ===

Since Feb 16, 2013, you can build Escort on Mac OS X from the master branch of [https://github.com/esrille/escort our GitHub repository].

Before building Escort on OS X, please set up [https://developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/ XCode], Command Line Tools for XCode, and 
[http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/ XQuartz].

We're also using [http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/ Homebrew] for installing libraries and tools that are used to build Escort as below:

{{{
$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)"
$ export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
$ export HOMEBREW_CC=llvm
$ export HOMEBREW_VERBOSE=1
$ brew install bison
$ brew link bison --force
$ brew install spidermonkey v8 re2c glew giflib jpeg
$ brew install boost --with-c++11
}}}

If you encounter errors during the above steps, please check HOMEBREW_CC (e.g. when “Illegal instruction: 4" occurs), and try older versions (e.g. use v8 3.9.24 instead of v8 3.15.11 when it doesn't build).

Then please clone [https://github.com/esrille/esidl esidl] and [https://github.com/esrille/escort escort] from the !GitHub repository, and the following steps should build esidl and escort:

esidl:
{{{
$ [srcidr]/esidl/configure CFLAGS=-g CXXFLAGS=-g
$ make
$ make install
}}}

escort:
{{{
$ [srcdir]/escort/configure CC=clang CFLAGS=-g CXX=clang++ CXXFLAGS=-g  
$ make 
}}}

To start Escort web browser, type from the command line like below:
{{{
$ ./Navigator.test [srcdir]/escort/data/navigator
}}}

Please refer to [BuildingWebBrowser this page] for more instructions.

== Starting Escort ==

=== Ubuntu Unity ===

Click the Ubuntu logo in the Launcher to start the [https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/ubuntu-help/unity-dash-intro.html Dash], 
and type "escort" in to the _Search_ bar.
The Dash will show you the ES logo icon. Select the ES logo icon to start Escort.

== Using Escort ==

The new Escort window initially opens about:blank page:

<img src="http://es-operating-system.googlecode.com/svn/html/Browser/r2840.blank.png" width="66.7%" height="66.7%">

There is a toolbar across the bottom of the window:

<img src="http://es-operating-system.googlecode.com/svn/html/Browser/r2840.toolbar.png" width="66.7%" height="66.7%">

The toolbar offers the following items:

  * ES logo button
  * Back button
  * Forward button
  * Location field
  * Reload button
  * Cancel button

Clicking the ES logo button brings the about: page (with version 0.2.0):

<img src="http://es-operating-system.googlecode.com/svn/html/Browser/r2840.about.png" width="66.7%" height="66.7%">

There is a blue link, "Esrille Inc.", in the fourth line on the about: page.
Try clicking on the link. Now Escort tries to bring the home page of Esrille Inc.
After you click on the link, the ES logo button switches to an animating gear icon 
to show you that the page transfer is in progress:

<img src="http://es-operating-system.googlecode.com/svn/html/Browser/r2840.loading.png" width="66.7%" height="66.7%">

When the page is completely loaded, the gear icon changes back to the ES logo icon,
and you'll see http://www.esrille.com/ in the location field:

<img src="http://es-operating-system.googlecode.com/svn/html/Browser/r2840.esrille.png" width="66.7%" height="66.7%">

The title bar of the Escort window shows the title and favicon of the page (if the page has one):

<img src="http://es-operating-system.googlecode.com/svn/html/Browser/r2840.titlebar.png" width="66.7%" height="66.7%">

To bring a web page by specifying a URL, click the location field, and type,

  `http://www.webstandards.org/files/acid2/test.html`
  
which is the URL of the [http://www.webstandards.org/action/acid2/ Acid2] test page:

<img src="http://es-operating-system.googlecode.com/svn/html/Browser/r2840.acid2-1.png" width="66.7%" height="66.7%">

Hit the `Enter` key to start loading the page.

<img src="http://es-operating-system.googlecode.com/svn/html/Browser/r2840.acid2-2.png" width="66.7%" height="66.7%">

To see the Acid2 test result, click on the blue link that reads, "Take The Acid2 Test":

<img src="http://es-operating-system.googlecode.com/svn/html/Browser/r2840.acid2.png" width="66.7%" height="66.7%">

At this point, Escort web browser implements [http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/ CSS 2.1] specification relatively well and
passes the Acid2 test.
It also passes about 90% of the tests in the [http://test.csswg.org/suites/css2.1/20110323/ CSS2.1 Conformance Test Suite].
We're going to support recent dynamic and rich Web pages and the
[http://www.webstandards.org/action/acid3/ Acid3] test 
in the future versions of the Escort browser.

== File Organization ==

The following is the file organization of the Escort web browser installation.

{{{
/usr/bin
    + escort          # shell script that executes the browser core
/usr/libexec/esrille/escort
    + escort          # browser core (binary executable)
/usr/share/applications
    + escort.desktop  # desktop file for freedesktop.org environment
/usr/share/esrille/escort
    + escort.html     # browser UI page
    + default.css     # default style sheet
    + escort.ico      # default window icon
    + etc.            # other image files used by escort.html
/usr/share/esrille/escort/about
    + blank           # about:blank page
    + index.html      # about: page
    + etc.            # other image files used by the about URL files
/usr/share/icons/hicolor/*x*/apps
    + escort.png      # icon files used by the GUI shell
}}}

The user specific configuration files are stored in,

{{{
$HOME/.esrille/escort
}}}

This is also where Escort creates its temporary cache files.

== Escort's user agent string ==

Escort's user agent string uses the format:

{{{
Escort/x.y.z
}}}

Where *x.y.z.* provides the version number of the package (such as "0.2.0").

_Note: The format may be changed in the future versions._
