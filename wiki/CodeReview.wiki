#summary Requesting code review

= Requesting Code Review =

To merge your code into the trunk, please follow the following steps:

{{{
$ cd [YOUR WORKING COPY OF THE MAIN TRUNK]
$ svn update
}}}

Make your changes. Then create a copy of the main trunk in your personal branch and commit your change there:

{{{
$ svn copy https://es-operating-system.googlecode.com/svn/trunk https://es-operating-system.googlecode.com/svn/branches/gsoc2009/[YOUR DIRECTORY]
$ svn switch https://es-operating-system.googlecode.com/svn/branches/gsoc2009/[YOUR DIRECTORY]/trunk
$ svn commit
}}}

Note: Your local changes will remain when you svn switch your working copy to the branch (see [http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.0/ch04s05.html the manual]).

To request code review, please visit,

 http://code.google.com/p/es-operating-system/source/detail?r=[REVISION # OF THE CHANGE]

and click "Request Code Review" link. Fill in the form and select your mentor(s) in the Owner field. Please also include es-operating-system-dev@googlegroups.com in the Cc list. Then click "Submit issue". Please read [http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/CodeReviews this page] for further information about code review.

Once your mentor(s) give you positive score(s) for your change, merge your change into the main trunk:

{{{
$ svn switch https://es-operating-system.googlecode.com/svn/trunk
$ svn merge -r [BRANCHED OUT REVISION #]:[YOUR CHANGE REVISION #] https://es-operating-system.googlecode.com/svn/branches/gsoc2009/[YOUR DIRECTORY]/trunk
}}}

Now you can commit your change to the main trunk. Please commit it with a meaningful log message since it will be included in the !ChangeLog file. Please read [http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Change-Logs.html this page] for how to write a change logs:

{{{
$ svn commit
$ svn delete https://es-operating-system.googlecode.com/svn/branches/gsoc2009/[YOUR DIRECTORY]/trunk
}}}
